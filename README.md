It's written in vanilla python, just run `python bezierRenderer.py`. To place a new curve, click anywhere, then click around to add points to the curve. To stop placing the curve, press `p` and the point under the mouse will go away.

To move a points in an existing curve, just click them, then click to set their new position.

To clear all of the curves, press `c`, and to quit, press `q`.

If you want to see how the curves are drawn, hit `i` to toggle intermediate drawing and use the left and right arrow keys to see the rendering happen.
