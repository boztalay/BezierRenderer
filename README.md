# BezierRenderer
A simple bezier curve renderer in Python that can draw curves of arbitrary order.

It's written in vanilla Python (2.7.6), just run `python bezierRenderer.py`. To place a new curve, click anywhere, then click around to add points to the curve. To stop placing the curve, press `p` and the point under the mouse will go away.

To move points in an existing curve, just click them, then click elsewhere to set their new position.

To clear all of the curves, press `c`, and to quit, press `q`.

If you want to see how the curves are drawn, hit `i` to toggle intermediate drawing and use the left and right arrow keys to see how the drawing happens.
